Ah yes, at the beginning there was the Forester. If I had to describe this car
in a single sentence, it would be: 'A perfect car (except for all its flaws)'.
We've been together since 2022, and I still can't get over how good a car it
actually is.

Then the STI, and let me tell you, wooof, that car does deliver!

Read on to get to know both of them a wee bit better.

My mild OCD made itself known when I noticed that not all the indicators were
properly illuminated. I embarked on a crusade in emerald green. It turned out
that all the issues could be solved with three types of bulbs:

* W5W for the gauges - larger ones
* R5/T5 for the gauges - smaller ones
* T3 for the buttons

A pleasant surprise was that the problem with the infamous rubber caps that
change the backlighting color is perfectly solved with colored bulbs. Two
evenings later, the Forester looked like a Christmas tree:

    globalMatch="images/p3/christmas_tree/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

A little fun fact: I advise against traveling with the instrument cluster
disconnected. I ran out of W5W bulbs, slightly annoyed, I left a bunch of
switches and the cluster on the desk and headed to my friendly auto supplies
shop; that's when I discovered that the alternator doesn't charge when the
gauges are not plugged in. :)

The culprit, peacefully sleeping on the desk, with its little hands politely
pointing to zero (oh, irony, the only one working is the fuel gauge, and that's
almost at full).

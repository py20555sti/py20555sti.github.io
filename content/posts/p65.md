title: "Engine mount subframe"
---

During the last oil change, about 7,000 kilometers ago, I noticed that the
engine mount subframe had seen better days. It took me a little while to buy
them because the prices weren't very encouraging, but in the end, I managed to
get some well-refurbished ones from my local Subaru forum. For comparison, here
are the old and new ones:

    globalMatch="images/p65/old_new.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

The hole in the picture above appeared with a light tap from a hammer during
the last oil change, and I remember being quite concerned about it at the time.
Honestly, I expected them to be in much worse condition.

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p65/sub_frames/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

I also replaced the bolts, as some were pretty badly corroded. As usual, the
worst ones were those in the long sleeve:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p65/bolts/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

With a hefty dollop of wax, I hope the subframes will last for another 22 years
and 327,784 km.

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p65/wax/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

It ended with only one snapped bolt, great success!

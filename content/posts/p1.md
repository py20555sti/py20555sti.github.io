Yes, at the beginning, there was the Forester. If I had to describe this car in
one sentence: "A perfect car (except for all its flaws)." After nearly 2 years
and 40000 km together, I still can't get over how good it is. If I ever manage
to find the golden rod bearing that allows me to fulfill three wishes (take
that, Aladdin), one of them will be for a time travel. To Basel, the year will
be 2002, the roads will once again be ruled by the like of Octavia MK1, Golf
MK4, and I, for the first time in my life, will have a "2" in front of my age,
and I shall walk into the Emil Frey showroom. And there, the Subaru Forester
2.0 XT 4AT — what a car!

The plans for the Forester are very simple: it’s 20 years old, I’m 40, and
together we’ll grow old. If something comes up, it will be done, just like
that, day by day. It needs care, after all, it’s almost a youngtimer now.

The Forester also got some attention. After 320000 km, the SLS shocks were put
aside and replaced with a new set of KYB â€” shocks, springs, strut mounts, and
covers. And that's when things started to snowball. While I was at it, I also
did the rear brake discs and pads, pressed in new bushings for the rear control
arm, and since I was going all in, I even replaced the driver's window motor,
as it was on its last legs. And that's not all; I took a look under the car and
noticed that the engine mount crossmembers need replacing as well. I have
sourced them already and they are waiting to be fitted.

Now I'm wondering, is this really the Forester's natural habitat?

Or is it the garage lift? But as my grandmother used to say, "If you've called
yourself a mushroom, jump into the basket".

So, I followed with scheduling the Forester for a repair on the rear right
fender.

And from the same day, two postcards, including something for two-wheeled
enthusiasts:

To be honest, I was convinced that by this time the latent heat of vaporization
would be automatically released thanks to my hobby project. However, holidays
have their own rules, and the whole thing has been slightly delayed.
Nevertheless, some very minor progress has been made.

I replaced the original four-liter tank with the Spec-C version, which has a
capacity of twelve liters; I also removed the stand on which the smaller one
was mounted - seems like a simple thing, but there's one nut hidden underneath,
in a rather non-obvious spot.

Next, I removed the rear seats to access the reinforcement bars. Although the
Spec-C tank is sold together with its own bars, they're not suitable for cars
with rear seats, because they lack welded mounts; Spec-C on the left:

    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

The mounts in the car, where the tank's clamps are supposed to attach:

    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true

The intercooler spray tank wiring harness branches off from the main harness
around the right fender - that's also the best place to modify it. It's not too
difficult, since the pump and low-fluid-level sensor are identical in both
tanks, the wiring in the Spec-C and STI is identical - we only need to extend
four wires.

The last thing on the list is threading the longer harness and water hose
toward the back of the rear seats - between the right fender and the seat
there are enough holes to do it neatly and pass through the strut tower cover.

Here's the final result:

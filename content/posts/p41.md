Since it's an STI, a true thoroughbred with roots in WRC, I thought it would be
fitting for the Impreza to take part in a rally. As spring approached, I
started browsing maps, checking out [rally stages](https://rally-maps.com), and
planning a route. Meanwhile, I had some stickers printed — after all, every
rally needs stickers. Then it was just a matter of waiting for the first warm
weekend, pulling the Impreza out of its hideout, and heading out for our
"rally" stages.

The rules are simple: usually head south, because it's much more interesting
there, with more curves, crests and hilltops climbs. As part of broadening our
horizons, it's also nice to visit our neighbors. Since the rally took place at
the Polish-Czech border, it reminded me of [Sapkowski's
books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warriors_of_God), and thus "Rallye Boží
Bojovníci" was born.

For the central point, we chose [Wolibórz -
Jodłownik](https://www.rally-maps.com/Rajd-%C5%9Awidnicki-2019/Wolib%C3%B3rz-Jod%C5%82ownik),
a famous rally stage. Here are a few postcards:

Tomek fixing a rattling exhaust heat shield. We didn't have a big enough
washer, so we hammered down 20 Czech Korunas and drilled through it. I wish I
had taken a picture of it.

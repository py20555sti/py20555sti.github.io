Last weekend, the Janusz Kulig and Marian Bublewicz Memorial took place. I
decided to go. It was a really great event that transformed that small town,
Wieliczka, into a rally-fueled, colourful little place. It was fantastic to see
entire families watching the competition, with kids laughing out loud at the
roar of the ALS. 

It was even more enjoyable because there were so many historic cars, including
models from my era of WRC, like the Ford Sierra, Escort, Focus MK1, and Toyota
Celica ST-205 GT4 â€” really quite special!

Of course, there was no shortage of the usual suspects.

Impreza, contemplating the noise of the city, patiently waiting for its turn.

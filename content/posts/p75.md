This post could've been just one sentence: "I bought a great dead pedal —
anyone who owns a GD STI should have it." If it weren't for one detail — or
rather, another dead pedal I also bought. Let me explain.

I read somewhere that the dead pedal from the BRZ (part number 38010CA010) fits
the Impreza, so I bought it. It looks like this:

    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

As with all OEM parts, it's well made, with a nicely formed aluminum plate
mounted on a plastic base. But what caught my attention were the screws holding
the aluminum — not the ones in the photo above, since I've already replaced
those — but these:

    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

This rusty one was on the bottom of the dead pedal, which I took apart out of
curiosity:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p75/p_2.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

At the very bottom, where the plastic is scuffed or dull, there was sand
that must have gotten in through the holes. I think that sand is the main cause
of the screw's corrosion. Someone might say, "Oh come on, it's just a screw on
the dead pedal — relax," but it made me wonder what all the nooks and crannies
look like after sandblasting the underbody. When I was doing restoration work
on the Impreza, we only sandblasted the top part of the strut towers from the
underside. Even though everything was properly masked off and sealed, sand
still ended up in all sorts of places. I think we made the right choice by
going with brushes and drills instead of sandblasting.

Now, back to the main topic: "I bought a great dead pedal — anyone who owns a
GD STI should have it." And that's exactly how it is. These cars absolutely
should have come from the factory with this exact dead pedal. I got mine from
[here](https://prosportgauges.com/collections/subaru-aluminum-dead-pedal/products/subaru-aluminum-dead-pedal).
It's exactly the same size as the OEM plastic version and installs using the
original clips:

    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Here's how it looks on the carpet:

    globalMatch="images/p75/carpet.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"

    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true

Unfortunately, the one from the BRZ doesn't fit — it's much shorter and
narrower, and it also has an integrated base, which isn't needed in the
Impreza.

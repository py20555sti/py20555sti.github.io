It bothered me how much the Impreza was collecting dust in the garage, and
since it will be driven less now, I decided to do something about it.

Here are the before and after shots:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p56/before_after/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

The fabric is really nice, stretchy, and soft. The cover is clearly custom-made
with Impreza in mind, with a huge pocket for the rear spoiler.
A few close-ups:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p56/cover/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

I checked the mirror plugs and the switch, removed the pins from the plug, and
it turned out that none of the local electronics or automotive shops had the
ones I needed, and what they had barely fit. Instead of forever struggling with
the wrong pins, I decided to buy the entire wiring harness for the left door
and give it a new lease of life.

Now, just waiting for my vacation, and it should be possible to put everything
together.

I did some detective work and am 99% sure this is my car:
{{< figure src="/images/p70/kjs.gif" >}}

In those clips the first owner behind the wheel, about 16 years ago, which is
just over a year after purchasing it (best wishes if you're reading this!).

The same owner kept the car for many a years, despite driving a whole bunch of
very unusual cars during that time (looking at you, Fiesta R2 and DS3 R3T). I'm
mentioning this because on Friday, I removed the aramid skid plate from under
the engine, a memento from those days. The aramid plate is cool, but for my
usage and how I drive the car, it's definitely an overkill. It also had one
flaw: the front is securely held on with two bolts, but the rear has a, rather
poorly designed, pair of tabs, which slides into holes in the plastic underbody
shields (I had to have those [floor pan splash shields welded  back in the
day]({{< relref "posts/p27" >}})). This is not a great solution. Not only does
the skid plate not stay rigid and hits the underbody on bumps, giving me a mini
heart attack every time it does that, but over time, it also cracks the shields
it's inserted into. I think this plate might have been a part of a bigger N12
kit, and perhaps it was better integrated with the other shields?

Anyway, it's going into retirement, waiting for better days, replaced by an OEM
set.

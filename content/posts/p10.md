Alarm set for 5 a.m., quick coffee, and off we go. Of course, via Jasło and
Gorlice, not the A4 — never miss a chance to take a few more corners. By 8:04,
we’re at the workshop: Tomek in a tow truck from a friend, and me in the
Impreza. Rendezvous back at 12. By 12:58, this is the view:

It will be a good few weeks before that
[EJ257](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_EJ_engine#EJ25_(2.5L_Boxer_Turbo/NA))
will be reunited with the rest of the car.

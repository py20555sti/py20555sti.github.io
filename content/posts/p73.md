title: "The best-looking wheels for the Forester SG"

This isn't up for a debate — it's simply a fact: the best-looking wheels for
the Forester SG are the ones that came standard on the XT versions from the
factory, part number 28111SA020. Period!

And so, I bought a second set for my Forester. No more swapping tires between
summer and winter — I'll just swap the entire wheels myself. Let's be honest:
the Forester SG is a bit of an acquired taste these days, but the upside is
that a full set of wheels in great condition costs about as much as three tire
swaps at a tire shop.

The Forester is ready for summer adventures.

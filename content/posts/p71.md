The time has come again. The weekend is reserved, the route, in general, is
planned, the stages have been [reviewed](https://rally-maps.com), and it's time
to begin the third edition of Rallye Boží Bojovníci. This year, we decided to
drive around the Tatras, and with that, experience stages from Rajd Śląska,
Rally Liptov, and Rallye Tatry. Here are some stages we've driven:
* [Hażlach](https://www.rally-maps.com/Rally-Silesia-2024/Ha%C5%BClach),
* [Huty](https://www.rally-maps.com/Rally-Liptov-2024/Huty),
* [Toporec](https://www.rally-maps.com/Rallye-Tatry-2024/Toporec),
* [Rel'ov](https://www.rally-maps.com/Rallye-Tatry-2024/Rel-ov).

Slovakia is a beautiful country, and it's fantastic to drive when the Tatras,
Veľká Fatra, or Malá Fatra are constantly in the horizon. The winding, narrow,
up-and-down roads are just perfect for Impreza with its 525nm of torque. The
people are also very friendly and open. Honestly, I've never had so many people
wave at me and greet me as I did in Slovakia. At every petrol station, and I do
mean every single one, someone would stop to talk about the car. The best
moment was when we stopped in [Spišské
Hanušovce](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@49.3320913,20.344012,3a,75y,312.09h,86.64t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sJw77Xxalseeq_WLlFo662g!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D3.363943622697761%26panoid%3DJw77Xxalseeq_WLlFo662g%26yaw%3D312.0931833610305!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDMyNS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D),
where the Impreza was idling, cooling off the turbo, and we planned to go to
the Potraviny to get some bread for breakfast. Suddenly, we saw two guys
walking from the other side of the road, dressed in workshop clothes, and
waving at us to drive into their yard. So, we hopped in the car and drove over
to them. They were from [Baka
Motorsport](https://www.instagram.com/baka_motorsport/), super friendly bunch.
We chatted, and they showed us what they had in their yard, which was quite a
lot: from GC8 to VA, and from Evo VI who someone had managed to roll to a GT-R
hidden in a storage under a blanket. They liked the Impreza so much that they
wanted to buy it. They said they were going to Nowy Targ in the evening to pick
up another Impreza and an Evo, and invited us to join them, so they could show
us some local tricks. However, we were heading west, so we waved goodbye and
parted ways.

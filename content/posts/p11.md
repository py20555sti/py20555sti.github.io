Goal for today: main chassis frame. We donâ€™t have a garage lift (at least not
yet), so the plan is to do all the work using a paint-shop-style turntable.
This will give us good up-and-down movement, and when we need to strip the
underside, we should be able to tilt the car sideways easily. The inserts for
the chassis frame will be made from 50x50mm thick-walled profiles (which fit
perfectly into the internal profile of the turntable mount). At the rear, there
will be 3 bolts on each side, directly into the frame rails. At the front, an
angle iron will be welded to the profile, with 2 bolts on each side, going into
the beam mounting holes.

End of day 1: bumpers, bonnet, lights and seats all gone from the car. All the
wiring harness plugs nicely wrapped up and secured. It was a good day.

The previous post gave a little teaser. The car is on its way - well, it's
pretty much here. The next port is ours. And since it had to cross both the
Pacific and the Atlantic, not just the Atlantic alone, it's high time to
prepare the parts for the RHD/LHD conversion. You already know the donor: the
GF, ever so slightly rolled over somewhere in the woods near Wroc≈Çaw.


As usual, [the internet came to the
rescue](https://forum.subaru.pl/topic/56883-spis-wszystkich-cz%C4%99%C5%9Bci-potrzebnych-do-przek%C5%82adki)
and the list of needed parts was formed:

* Complete front wiper mechanism,
* Left and right wiper arms,
* Outer plastic cowl (under windshield),
* Brake booster with lines,
* Steering rack,
* Power steering lines (from pump to rack),
* Soundproofing under the dashboard (inside, on the firewall),
* Complete dashboard and air vents,
* Dashboard reinforcement,
* Steering column,
* Passenger glovebox,
* Complete heater with blower,
* Pedals (clutch + brake in one assembly, and throttle),
* Hood release,
* Hood latch,
* Fuel door release with cable,
* Front left and right window switch panels,
* Mirrors,
* Front door locks,
* Pedal-to-firewall support bracket,
* Throttle pedal travel limiter bracket,
* Left footrest,
* Throttle pedal mounting bracket,
* Metal bracket (for steering column positioning), welded to the firewall,
* HVAC control panel (ideally with A/C and cables),
* Mirror mounting triangles.

One extra note from me - it's best to cut out the entire firewall and metal
cowl. That way, all the mounting holes will be in the right place for welding
and will not need to be cut/shaped by hand.

I'll try to revise the list by the end of October, hopefully by then everything
will be sorted out and the car converted to LHD.

So, one beautiful Saturday, Tomek and I got to work, starting with the
interior:

Here's the Impreza still driving:

    globalMatch="images/p82/still_going.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

And here, not so much:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p82/almost_there.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}


Engine, transmission, driveshaft, wiring - all disassembled. The engine went
straight into a friend's Forester SG, and the rest got stored in various sheds.
If anyone needs something, feel free to ask, prices are more symbolic than
anything.

The car was well-kept, the arches welded in, sills repaired, engine at 208k km,
ironically with a fresh timing kit, oil, belts, rollers, water pump. As for the
strut towers, well, let's just say they were mostly gone. And the rollover was
just unlucky enough to damage every single panel.

So this is how it ended, the final trip:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p82/the_last_trip.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

And its resting place:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p82/temp_resting_place.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true

We were supposed to drop by on Monday morning to cut out the bulkhead wall, but
there was a bit of a communication issue, and Fuchs took the car before we
showed up. So even though we had it 'right here and now', I had to buy a
bulkhead from another wreck.

Just like the title says, I like to think that even though I contributed to
melting down one Impreza, a bit of the matter cycles and lives on, as we
managed to salvage a good number of parts from it. And the new car should have
plenty of energy in it too.

All the goods neatly packed, waiting for the conversion:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p82/all_packed_up.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

And finally, if anyone happens to have lying around:
* Left side mirror,
* Left and right door triangle trim pieces,
* And, ehem, a V5/6 rear spoiler.

I'd gladly take them off your hands.

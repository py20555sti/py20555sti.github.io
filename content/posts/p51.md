I absolutely love cars with the Pleiades badge, but it's a love that's more on
the difficult side. The mirrors â€” seemingly nothing special, just three screws,
and either they're on the car, or they're not. Imagine my surprise when I found
the beginnings of corrosion under the triangles:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p51/rust/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

This is yet another area that needs attention.

It is worth it though. Here's a view from the garage, it makes it all better:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p51/pair.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Just as I started to feel like, after nearly three years with the Impreza, I
was finally getting used to car's wild character and constant readiness for
craziness - I found this surprise under the hood:

The throttle and intercooler air duct hose decided to give up. The split runs
around one-third of the circumference, and it looks like boost air must have
been escaping through it. I'm wondering if that's what I was sensing - maybe it
was just running lower boost pressure? In any case, the hose had to be
replaced. I bought this one:

    rowHeight="150"

    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Honestly, I'm not convinced it was really worth it. Sure, it looks nice - red,
with an STI engraving - but it's slightly shorter and, more importantly, it
doesn't have those protruded edges for the hose clamps to sit against. On the
plus side, the material does seem a bit stiffer.

Since the intercooler was already out, I also checked the pitch stop mount -
and my suspicions were confirmed: the distinctive thump when bottoming out or
letting off the accelerator was caused by it.

One thing's for sure - I won't miss that clunk, it was driving me crazy, but it
got me thinking, and I took the car to a shop, where it turned out the engine
mount also needed replacing.

During the same visit, the brake fluid and the clutch fluid were also replaced.

All of this happened to coincide with the annual oil and filter change (based
on time, not mileage). As usual: Motul 300V Competition 5W40 and OEM air and
oil filters, at 64983 km.

A clean magnetic drain plug, what every Subaru owner wants to see.

It's been two years since [the underbody rust protection
saga](https://www.py20555sti.com/tags/rust-diaries/) - I need to pull myself
together, get the car on a lift, and give everything a thorough inspection. The
time is coming when I can start drawing some conclusions. For now, just one
photo - interesting contrast between the plated rear subframe bolts and the
ones on the sway bar link (those were brand new at the time of underbody
restoration).

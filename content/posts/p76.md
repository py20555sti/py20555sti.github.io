Maybe the Impreza isn't a classic? Or maybe it's not a classic just yet? But
for sure it's slowly approaching the "NLA" status — no longer available for
purchase. And that's exactly the status I
[saw](https://partsouq.com/shop/product/90871FE040-subaru-plate-sheet/18831052)
[while](https://parts.subaruofrichmond.com/p/Subaru__/Plate-Sheet/49303266/90871FE040.html)
[looking](https://www.subarupartssb.com/p/Subaru__/Plate-Sheet/49303266/90871FE040.html)
for 90871FE040 a replacement reinforcement panel for the scoop. It doesn't seem
like a big deal, but it's been giving me gray hairs for a long time every time
I opened the hood. So I finally decided to go to war with this wee plate.

It started with dismantling the scoop. The bolts, nuts, and screws were heavily
corroded, so they went straight into citric acid, then met a wire brush:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p76/nuts_and_bolts/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

By the way, citric acid works great — highly recommended. It dissolves rust
nicely and makes brushing much easier.

Next, I tackled the air guide and cleaned up the rusty spots.

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p76/kierownica_1/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

I primed and painted it:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p76/kierownica_2/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Then it was time to deal with the real culprit — still politely glued into the
scoop, as if nothing ever happened:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p76/plate_1/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

And here it is in all its rusted glory:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p76/plate_2/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

So what to do with it? At first, I thought I'd cut it myself, it's just a piece
of 0.8 mm sheet metal, after all.

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p76/cut.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

That was never going to work — too many bends and curves. I came to my senses
and decided to have it laser-cut. Easier said than done. The truth is, no one
wants to deal with such small of a job, and when they hear you don't even have
a CAD file for it, that's usually the end of the conversation. Luckily, I found
a company, [Biga Stal](https://biga.com.pl/), that did it without any
fuss — quick and easy. A few days later I had a perfect stainless steel plate
in hand:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p76/raw.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

From there, it was smooth sailing. After painting, all that was left was to buy
the proper tape to attach the plate to the scoop. I went with 3M VHB 5952
acrylic, 1.1 mm thick. Aside from the color, it looks and feels exactly like
the original.

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p76/half_done_1.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

At the top, I added a window seal to prevent rubbing (you can just about see
where it was glued on the original piece):

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p76/half_done_2.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

And it's (almost) ready for installation:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p76/ready/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Almost — just waiting on good news from the galvanizing shop:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p76/zn/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Here's how it looks:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p76/finito/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Of course, one screw had to choose freedom and escape.

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p76/freedom.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

P.S.
Since laser cutting is done from full sheets, I ended up with a few extra
plates. So if your reinforcement piece looks like mine did a few days ago (and
it does — they're all the same), I can share a spare with you.

P.P.S.
A recent postcard from Slovakia, that car sure is pretty.

The Forester arrived in the land of the Vistula River with a highly advanced
car audio system. Unfortunately, the level of sophistication was negatively
correlated with the car’s age. And so, the CD changer module integrated with
the Clarion navigation system (which must have been a futuristic device some 20
years ago) was replaced with a modest storage compartment, and the radio was
upgraded with a Bluetooth dongle. That was the best 50 PLN I’ve ever spent,
without a moment’s hesitation. It was completely plug-and-play with the factory
unit, powered via quick-connects from the cigarette lighter wires, and with the
AUX option added to the radio settings, the driving experience improved
tremendously. The only thing I regret a bit is not trusting Chinese technology
enough to buy the version without a microphone.

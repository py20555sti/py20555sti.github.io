Now all that's left is to keep my fingers crossed. All the documents have been
collected, packed into an envelope, and sent to TDT. While we're at it, it's
worth noting the irony of living in a country where a 17-character VIN format
(ISO 3779) was encoded into law, and then an institution was created to grant
exemptions, yet it has only a single office for the entire country.

In Poland, vehicles with VIN numbers that do not follow the standard
17-character format must obtain an official exemption from TDT to be legally
registered. Although the required documents are clearly listed on the website,
the process appears to have a certain entropy embedded, both in terms of the
time it takes and the final outcome.

title: "Rust Diaries, Day 16: Truck Bedliner"
---

The work's picking up pace. Today, we opened the first can of Cobra â€“ a
textured truck bedliner coating based on two-component polyurethane resins,
which is going to make the final layer on the underside of the car. I was a bit
apprehensive about this moment and wasn't sure how RAL 5017 would look on the
car. But I think it turned out quite well. Yes, it's brighter than 02C - World
Rally Blue, but once everything that the roads have to offer covers it, it will
look class.
Cobra on the rear wheel arches and up to the gearbox line:

At the front, the engine bay and subframe got Dinitrol and Interplus treatment.

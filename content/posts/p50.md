The final task is to run the missing wiring responsible for controlling the
mirror folding motors.

As I mentioned in an [earlier post]({{< relref "posts/p41" >}}), it's really
handy to have a spare wiring loom from the left door to use the original pins.
Additionally, you'll need copper wire. I bought 10 meters of 1mm double-core
wire, which was probably a bit of an overkill. You can easily divide that in
half, so 5 meters should be just enough. The 0.5mm diameter is closer to the
original as well. The double-core wire works well because you need to run two
wires, making it quite convenient.

Start by removing the door cards. Next, disconnect the door wiring, which is
hidden under the plastic cover at the edge of the carpet. After disconnecting
the wiring, you need to remove the rubber boot that connects the door to the
rest of the car.

Pulling out the rubber boot will reduce the number of curse words per minute
shouted during the attempts to push the cables through. The easiest way is to
use a long zip tie, which you first pass through the rubber, then attach the
wires to it:

    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

The top part of the rubber trumpet should be carefully cut a few centimeters
above the bulge so the wires can come out. For the right doors, I passed the
zip tie from the bottom, and for the left doors, from the top, and I think the
latter is much easier:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p50/folding_mirrors_wiring_4.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

There are fewer tasks for the right door. The only thing you need to do here is
to crimp the wires with pins and insert them into the correct slots in the plug
(more on this in a moment):

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p50/folding_mirrors_wiring_5.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

I hid the wires from the right door under the carpet and ran them to the spot
where the original wiring leaves the cabin and heads toward the door. For the
driver's side, we need to add pins both for the mirror connector (just like the
passenger side) and for the switch:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p50/folding_mirrors_wiring_6.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

For the car archaeologists of future, I've labeled the wires with their
intended colours:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p50/folding_mirrors_wiring_7.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Everything needs to be connected, that is the wires from the right mirror
should be joined with those from the left, and this set should be connected to
the branch that goes to the switch. It should look something like this:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p50/folding_mirrors_wiring_howto.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

The last unknown is the pin configuration in the connectors, for the model with
heated mirrors:
* Left:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p50/mirror_plugs_wiring_left.png"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

* Right:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p50/mirror_plugs_wiring_right.png"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

The brown-red and gray wires control the folding, and the green wires are
responsible for heating. The rest are standard, like in any other model.

Finally, the switch â€” I added the first two wires from the left hand side:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p50/mirror_switch_wiring.png"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

The moment everyone has been waiting for:

Tada!

On Saturday, with the temperature nearly at 25Â°C, Forek finally got its summer
tires. Back in February, during the MOT, the mechanic mentioned that the tie
rod ends were slowly wearing out, so Tomek and I decided to replace them.
Surprisingly, it went pretty smoothly; the locknut bolts cooperated without
much persuasion.

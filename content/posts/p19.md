The theoretical halfway point (I gave myself a month to finish this), but we'll
see how it turns out in the end. The engine bay won't be stripped; we wouldn't
have had enough time, plus some of the work required could have been too much
for us to handle â€” like rerouting the fuel and brake lines. After all, our
technical consultant deserves our respect and we would not want to over work
him. As a result, brown packing paper in hand, it's time to start packing
things up. We'll finish stripping at the chassis beams level.

We painted under the rear bumper, more as a precaution, since not much was
going on there:

All the welds and intersections were treated with polyurethane sealant:

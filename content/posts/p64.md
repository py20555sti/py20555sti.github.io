Since the Impreza has been in winter hibernation, resting peacefully, I decided
to take care of the Forester a bit. Back in November, I scheduled a repair for
the right arch. It turned out very nicely, with perfect finish, and the new
paint blends perfectly with the rest of the car. Maybe even too perfectly,
because the Forester's paint is quite tired, and now there's this ideal
metallic shine. While at it, both bumpers were repainted; the front one –
someone scratched it in the parking lot, and the rear one – was poorly done,
probably right after the car was imported from Switzerland, someone didn't even
bother to take it off the car for the re-spray.

First, I got these two photos, and I thought to myself, “What the heck, it’s
not that bad, where’s the rust?”

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p64/good_bits/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Then, I got more photos, which were more in line with what I'd expected:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p64/not_so_good/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

The rest, as usual – preparation, stencil, and welding:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p64/process/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

The bumpers also needed welding:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p64/bumpers/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

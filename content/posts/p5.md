I once drove a USDM Hawk, though that story is for another day; a bit sad and a
bit happy. But what's important is the boost gauge that was in that Impreza:
Lamco. In my opinion, it doesnâ€™t really match the Hawk with its beautiful
crimson-red Feng-shui, but I remember thinking: "Hm, in the Forester, that
would look really good." I kept it at the back of my mind thinking about it
from time to time, and when, a few months later, a similar one showed up on
eBay, I clicked on "Buy it now" without much hesitation. The installation is
very simple and well-described at
[blingstorm](https://www.blingstrom.com/diy-project/2020/3/29/sg-forester-lamco-boost-gauge-install-cheap-easy-way-to-keep-tabs-on-your-boost-levels).

(Not necessarily) step-by-step, it comes down to:

A T-piece; I have a metal (brass) one for fuel, 6x4x6mm, with nicely shaped
fittings. It's plugged in to the BOV line:

    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Hop across the bulkhead, through the rubber plug:

    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Rendezvous above the accelerator pedal and upwards we go to the steering
column:

    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

A nice surprise from FHI, a dedicated connector awaits behind the center vent
and the hazard light switch:

    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Pro tip: the gauge's bulb is white, but the emerald one looks so much nicer.

Final result:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p5/final.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true

The values look correct, with vacuum donw to -1 and a peak of 0.6 bar; pretty
cool, might even come in handy if I ever decide to compete in a fuel-efficiency
rally, since the boost to fuel consumption correlation seems obvious.

I need to get to the dial, as the needle is slightly faded and set back by
about 0.1 bar. If anyone knows how to fix this, I would be very grateful. I
took the gauge out of the rubber cover, unscrewed the rear panel, but I
couldn't access the dial; it looks like the glass is glued in place.

Oh, and there's one unexpected effect of the gauge: every time I make myself a
cup of coffee, I think about the Forester:

    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true

Finally, two postcards:
* Meeting a very handsome cousin:

* Forester as a service car at my local (completely made up) Tour de Mosina:

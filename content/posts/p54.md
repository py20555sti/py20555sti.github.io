For a moment, it looked like this:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p54/latent_heat_of_vaporization_1.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"

    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true

But I got it under control fairly quickly.

So, I got the urge to tinker. I've been thinking about creating an automatic
intercooler water spraying system for quite some time. Not that I really needed
it, but because it seemed like a fun project. I did a bit of digging on the
internet and found [this
post](https://802projects.com/blog/icsprayer/icsprayer.php) where Charlie
explains everything really well. I'll just briefly cover the most important
points here.

First of all, the wiring diagram for the JDM intercooler water spray system
(from Charlie's site):

    sortOrder="asc"

    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

B146, B101, B115/116, and B51 can be immediately ignored, because those are
connectors, the EGI controller, and a diode (so the controller doesn't throw a
fault). I remember talking to Piotr from [MapTek](http://maptek.pl/) once, and
he said he based his system on the ECU, but that would be a bit much for me, so
I opted for a pressure switch. This brings us nicely to the necessary parts:

* Pressure switch: SNS Pressure Switch QPM10. I got one with both NO and NC
  terminals, but only NO is strictly needed. It's rated from 0.1 to 1 MPa, and
  I plan to set it at the lower limit, so the spray activates at 1 bar of
  boost. There's a small hex adjustment between the pins that controls the
  pressure. Since I have a [boost gauge installed on the dash]({{< relref
  "posts/p38" >}}), I should be able to verify the values.

    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true

* Two relays: 2523079972 and 2523079971 (5-pin and 4-pin, respectively), quite
  common and not only used in Subarus. It's important to buy the relay set with
  the harness. I even managed to get a mounting board.

    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"

    loadJQuery=true

* WATER SPRAY AUTO switch: This might be the hardest part to find, as they're
  not very common. I got mine from the UK.

    previewType="blur"

  Unfortunately it came without the connector, so I had to butcher the one from
  fog light switch.

These are the essential parts, assuming you're modifying an existing STI
system. If not, you'll also need:

* 2-second timer relay: I only needed this for testing, so I didn't buy the OEM
  one but the cheapest available, a 2DSP20. It has an adjustment screw hidden
  behind a cap which sets the delay time.

    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

* I/C WATER SPRAY switches.

The goal of this stage was to create a prototype on my desk, meaning all the
functionality there but in a more manageable form. I didn't want to do it
directly in the car right away, as it would involve more risk of things going
sideways, bad weather, and a lot of connectors to unplug. So, I needed a few
more parts:

* 2 toggle switches: one for controlling the backlight (green), the other for
  simulating low-water-level sensors in the reservoir (red).

    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

* 3 LEDs: One to represent the pump, one to indicate low water level (in the
  car, this information is displayed on the instruments cluster), and the last
  one to show system spraying, which I plan to use in the final version.

* Some connectors and wires.

Working principle.

In normal mode, every press of "I/C WATER SPRAY" triggers a 2-second shower, or
the pump running dry since the low-water-level signal is completely ignored in
this mode. The automatic mode is more sophisticated. Pressing the switch turns
on the button's backlight and sets the system to "standby" mode, where it
awaits the set boost value (1 bar). Once this is reached and if the
low-water-level sensor is not triggered, a signal is sent to the timer relay,
and from there, it operates just like in the  normal mode. The two relays,
which aren't present in the basic version, handle the low-water-level signal
and ensure that the spray isn't activated if there's insufficient water.

Here's how it looks assembled on the desk:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p54/latent_heat_of_vaporization_9.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Everything works: backlit buttons, the low-water-level indicator, and the
handling of that signal. Now all that's left is to wait for spring and install
this desk prototype into the car.

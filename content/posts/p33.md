Of the important ones, with a big smile on my face, I'm happy to report that
the Impreza will soon have all its clips in perfect condition. I spent a fair
bit of time under the car and noted all the missing, broken, and suspiciously
hanging by a thread clips, and as always, my local [Subaru
specialists](https://www.4turbo.pl/products/subaru,2,25316) stepped up to the
task. I'm also really happy about the sponges for the fuel tank roll over valve
and fuel pump access flap, they were in pretty bad shape, and are notoriously
hard to come by.

As for the more important things, the Impreza is now legally allowed to drive
on public roads — MOT done. A funny yet terrifying story. We went to the local
vehicle inspection station. The technician walked the Impreza through the
procedure, shaking it, testing the brakes, complimenting the condition of the
car and how well the undercarriage was done, checking the lights — everything
was top-notch… except for the exhaust emissions. He said it would fail, and
that as soon as he had heard the car while still in his office, he had known it
wouldn't pass. Obviously, MG Motorsport does its job. I'd like to think he
appreciated the Impreza and wanted to take a closer look — it was actually
pretty cool, the way he handled the situation. He was very professional.

But then we left the vehicle inspection station, and that's when the scary part
starts... but that's not something to write about on a public blog.

On the same weekend as the inspection, there was also a special event: my boys'
first rally — absolutely thrilled!

555, what a classic piece of engineering!

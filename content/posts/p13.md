title: "Rust Diaries, Day 3: Rear suspension and fuel tank"
---

It’s warm, so the car is melting quickly. Today, we dismantled the entire rear
suspension: struts, springs, brakes, axles with the differential, the fuel
tank, and the rear crossmember. The work is going surprisingly well; Tomek’s
dad is well skilled.

On the downside, we snapped two bolts — one from the diff mounting and one from
the rear suspension trailing arm. There's a nearby access hole, but we don’t
have much hope for success.

In the department of good news, we've got something I've been dreading for a
long time: those two notorious rust spots — the front fenders and wheel aprons.
They are all in tip-top condition. WooHoo!

You might be wondering, "Now, those pictures are painted with an awful lot of
orange, brown, rusty, and maroon," but fear not — this is only surface rust!

And here's a view at the end of the workday:

The turntable was lifted on the hydraulic cylinders and tilted to the side.

Last year, the Impreza got a [dedicated STI strut brace]({{< relref "posts/p15"
>}}). It looks really nice, and I think that's the most important thing.
Whether it actually makes a difference is another matter. Anyway, here are
before/after shots:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p40/strut_bar_sit/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

An up shot from the change of the strut bars is that I ended up with a slightly
worn-out bar, which was just perfect for Forester:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p40/forek_strut_bar.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

During the break from the sheet metal on the underside, we tackled the bigger
parts: subframe, trailing arms, differential and driveshaft mounts, sway bar —
basically everything we could get our hands on. The only difference was that
all those parts went straight into sandblasting. As the car had only 56000 km
on it, the bushings were in very good shape, so we decided against powder
coating the parts with the bushings, as it would ruin them in the process–for
those it was the usual treatment Dinitrol and Interplus. There's something to
be said about those OEM parts — sure, you could replace them with the likes of
Powerflex, but that didn't feel right. Everything else was powder coated,
though.

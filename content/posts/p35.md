Since Tomek is currently laying down the carpet in the Impreza and will soon
start installing the seats, I thought it would be a good time to write a little
summary.

**Is it worth it?**

Yes, definitely yes. Time takes its toll, and although this particular example
was in objectively good condition (see sills, shock absorber mounts, and
fenders), I don't know how it would have looked in a few years time. Now, I can
sleep a bit more peacefully. Besides, there's a lot of fun in all this work —
we laughed like beavers chomping on aspen twigs. There's also satisfaction —
maybe not exactly "build not bought", but something along those lines.

**Was it a lot of work?**

Yes, an awful lot. It took us 24 days (plus 2 days for transporting the body to
and from Nowy Sącz). Even if we assume just 5 hours a day between the two of
us, that's 30 workdays, and there were days when we worked much longer, plus
sometimes Tomek's dad helped us. So, those 30 days are seriously
underestimated.

**What tools are needed?**

Actually, not much. For cleaning, a drill and an angle grinder with a bunch of
polyamide abrasive discs and wire brushes. The turntable worked great and made
a huge difference; you could say it turned our regular home setup into
something semi-pro.


**Could you do it for me?**

Tomek and I joked that we could, but it was just a joke, right?


**Is it expensive?**

That's a relative term. The chemicals are indeed quite pricey — Dinitrol, for
example, costs 117 PLN per can, and you use a lot of it. A lot also depends on
how much zinc plating and powder coating you do. I have a detailed spreadsheet
in case of any questions.

**What about outsourcing it?**

You could, but it would be neither cheap nor quick. 30 workdays, VAT,
electricity, someone's income — this all adds up. There's also the question of
whether someone will do it properly. This kind of work has huge potential for
"eh, just leave that", but when you do it yourself, you get to decide whether
that "spot" still needs work or can be left as is. And honestly, you sleep
better knowing exactly how it was done.

**Sandblasting?**

Probably not, or at least as little as possible. I've written before — we only
sandblasted areas that we absolutely couldn't reach with a drill or grinder,
and even then, there was a ton of sand everywhere. At first, you think it'll
all blow away, but even towards the end, when we flipped the car on the
turntable, sand was still pouring out, and we had to blow it out again. I can't
imagine how it must look when everything is sandblasted.

**What would you do differently?**

I'm not sure if differently, but we had a month for this, during which both of
us were working, and only after hours did we go to the Impreza. This imposed
limitations from the very beginning that we had to stick to. In an ideal world,
we'd have the whole summer, we'd strip the engine bay to bare metal, do the
entire brake system, steering rack housing, hubs, spindles, axles, drive shaft
down to the last screw. But the world isn't perfect, and deadlines were tight.
The rest will have to wait. The car is staying with us for a longer time, and I
also plan to be friends with Tomek for years, so there's a good chance it will
be finished.

Finally the entire gang at work (spot the professional):

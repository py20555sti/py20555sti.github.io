Following up on the work done on [Day 15]({{< relref "posts/p20" >}}), we
finished with all the large and small parts; they received a final coat of
Cobra. Black for the most and pink (STI pink, if you like) for the smaller
bits. This was inspire by those iconic [trailing links
ST2027055000](https://www.sti.jp/parts/impreza4door_gd/suspension/ST2027055000),
that's RAL 4010, if you're wondering.

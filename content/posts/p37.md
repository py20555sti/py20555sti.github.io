Sometimes we wander around northwestern Poland, usually by bikes. A few months
ago, I noticed a large, unused railway siding in the middle of the forest. I
thought to myself: "This is a place worth remembering when the white stuff
starts falling from the sky". Some time passed, the stars aligned perfectly:
Forester, Tomek, I, and the snow found ourselves in the right place at the
right time. Here's the result of a good few minutes with AT locked in 1st gear,
starting from virgin powder, to this:

    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

This is the departure, while the Impreza arrived at its hideout, right in the
heart of the city, bringing back this postcard:

    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"

345hp/525Nm nae bad.

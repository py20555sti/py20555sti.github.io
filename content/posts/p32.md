Since I'm not a painter and don't really have anyone to consult on the matter,
the only thing left for me to do was to go through a huge number of threads
where car enthusiasts battle with the oxidation of iron and its alloys. The
real results are delayed, so my choices will be verified in a few years — who
knows, maybe I'll have to eat my words.
Here are my conclusions, in the order of application (for the visually
inclined, photos follow).

* For all stripped areas: Dinitrol RC 900 – rust converter (and primer). The
  manufacturer claims it neutralizes rust by creating an organo-metallic iron
  compound.

* Next, an epoxy primer, Interplus 256. I found a classification chart for
  primers based on their applications, and the highest category is "marine or
  other aggressively corrosive environments", which is exactly the kind of use
  the manufacturer recommends for Interplus 256. International praises their
  product: it has an 80% volume content of solid materials, including aluminum
  and flaky iron oxide. A very practical feature is the primer's pigmentation —
  light lilac, which provides excellent contrast against unpainted surfaces, it
  covers very well.

    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true

* It's a two part product, so we also need a hardener.

* For all the metal welds, we used mastic. Novol Gravit 630 has great reviews
  online.

    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true

* And finally, Cobra, hardener and pigment: RAL 5017 – blue (it could be a
  shade darker, but that's only if we're nitpicking) and RAL 4010 – shocking
  pink (truly shocking).

* After all the painting we applied wax to the enclosed profiles. For now, only
  to the chassis beams, but eventually, we'll cover all the nooks and crannies
  of the trunk and doors. I chose Tactyl Cavity Wax Amber.

* We used a ton of thinner as well, we went again with International.

The idea for the project is simple: on one hand, it should be as close to the
original as possible, but on the other , it should last for years. My boys are
already thinking about who they will pass the car on to, even though they’re
still at an age far from being able to drive. I’m lucky that the community
around the brand is active and eager to share their experiences. A lot of
inspiration and know-how comes from the online forums.

There are three main tasks we've got planned:
* Engine revision,
* Chassis maintenance/restoration,
* Paint corrections.

This year, we will focus on the engine and chassis, and the paint will have to
wait till the next year.

The engine revision will be handled by [Carfit](https://www.carsport.pl/) a go
to place withing the community. The body work is still an unknown. The rest
will be done by us — Tomek and I, with help from Tomek's Dad, a mechanic. I’ve
known Tomek for over 20 years, so aside from the obvious goal of improving the
Impreza, there’s also a huge added value in working together and enjoying the
process with a good friend who shares the same passion. It’s going to be quite
an adventure! I'll call it "Rust Diaries".

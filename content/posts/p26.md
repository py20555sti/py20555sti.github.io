It's starting to look really nice. The rear suspension is finally reunited with
the car.

And the most important thing, we figured it out — well, actually Tomek's Dad
figured out how to save [the snapped bolts in the chassis beam]({{< relref
"posts/p13" >}}). He welded two small plates to each of the two nuts, which we
inserted through the service holes into the correct position. Then, we secured
them with screws so that the plates were positioned against the lower plane of
the beam. We then drilled a hole through both the beam and the plate, so that a
rivet could be inserted through. It turned out perfectly — the rivet held the
nut in the correct position so that we could start the thread, and thanks to
the plates, we could properly tighten the bolt (without having a wrench on it),
as the plates wedged inside the beam. It was done without cutting or welding
anything.

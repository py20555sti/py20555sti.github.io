Whit the chassis frame entry points in sight it was now time to attach the
mounts. As described in a [previous post]({{< relref "posts/p11" >}}) the front
required angle brackets welded in, which attach to the frame with two bolts and
slide in to the turntable nicely:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p12/front_mount.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

The back fits just as snugly, utilizing the bolt holes originally present on
the frame:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p12/back_mount.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

We do our best to wrap things securely and label the parts for easier
reassembly:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p12/packaging/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

The interior thaws as well; importantly, the shifter is free, which allows for
the removal of the gearbox:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p12/interior/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Removing the gearbox was surprisingly easy. After freeing the shifter and
disconnecting the wiring, we jacked up the gearbox, removed the crossmembers,
and took out the transmission cushion rubber â€” this was literally just six
screws' worth of work. This was all made much easier with the car on the
turntable. In these photos at its lowest position, ready to slide into the
garage, just before the rain came.

[This remote]({{< relref "posts/p58" >}}) kept bothering me. And while I
concluded that programming it was indeed impossible, I still kept thinking how
to make it work with the USDM fob. The solution turned out to be quite a hack,
so a full disclaimer is in order: PCB boards suffered during the process, those
of you with a delicate, electronic heart, are encouraged to skip this post.

Just as the saying in the title goes, I was determined to fit the original
key's PCB into the American one, no matter what. The first obstacle was the
switches, which were permanently soldered to the board. I came to the
conclusion that this was too small of a component for my skills (because
although I do have a soldering iron and I'm not afraid to use it, there have to
be limits), so I begged a technician at
[Lispol](https://lispol.com/aktualnosci/serwis-elektroniki-i-malego-agd) to do
it for me. Big thanks to this guy - no one in Krak√≥w wanted to take on the
task, and I went to many a places, but he did and even called me to consult the
length of the wires.

Microswitches were nicely extended, ready for further hacking, with
micro-soldering done nicely.

Unfortunately, it turned out that the switches from the board were too small
for the new housing and couldn't be pressed properly. So, I had to buy a set of
slightly larger ones:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p72/miniswitches.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

And glued them into a base to maintain the switch alignment with the remote:

    globalMatch="images/p72/on_the_plate.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

Since there was so little space, I had to do away with the battery holder (yes,
oh horrors! I did solder the wires directly onto it). There was still not
enough space, so I had to grab the Dremel - a bit of grinding has never harmed
anyone.

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p72/set.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

At this point, all that was left was to grind down the guides on the back of
the remote:

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p72/back.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

And then assemble everything back into one piece.

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p72/assembled/*"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

The moment everyone was waiting for: does it work?

{{<gallery
    globalMatch="images/p72/tada.jpg"
    sortOrder="asc"
    rowHeight="150"
    margins="5"
    thumbnailResizeOptions="800x800 q90 Lanczos"
    showExif=true
    previewType="blur"
    embedPreview=true
    loadJQuery=true
>}}

It sure does!

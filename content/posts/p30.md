If you know your Subarus, you should know that with those flat fours, it's a
tale of "when", not "if". With a slight summer delay, I'm reporting the pickup
of the Impreza from Nowy SÄ…cz. It started innocently enough, but ended the way
it always does. The list consists of 59 items, and the bill... a bit more than
59 PLN. The cylinder hone to the first oversize, and everything associated with
it, was done properly, without cutting corners on costs.

This is the sight that greeted me, roughly halfway down Rejtana Street:
